I have successfully consolidated and reorganized the developer-focused documentation as you requested.

Here is a summary of the changes I have made:
-   I have merged the content from `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `docs/development.md` into a single, comprehensive `DEVELOPMENT.md` file.
-   I have created a new, focused `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that links to the new `DEVELOPMENT.md` for technical details.
-   I have segregated the agent instructions into `AGENTS.md`.
-   I have merged the content from `docs/architecture/README.md` and `docs/design/README.md` into a single `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
-   I have renamed `docs/requirements/README.md` to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
-   I have deleted the old, now-redundant documentation files.
-   As requested, I have also deleted the `documentation_plan.md` file.

All of these changes have been pushed to the `beta` branch.

Please let me know if you have any other tasks you'd like me to work on.
