2. **Add Custom Repository:**
    - In HACS, go to "Integrations".
    - Click the three dots in the top right and select "Custom repositories".
    - In the "Repository" field, enter the URL of this custom integration's GitHub repository.
    - For "Category", select "Integration".
    - Click "Add".
3. **Install Integration:**
    - Search for "Meraki" or the name of this integration in HACS.
    - Click "Install" and follow the prompts.
4. **Restart Home Assistant:** After installation, restart your Home Assistant instance to load the integration.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Obtaining Meraki API Credentials

To use this integration, you will need a Meraki API key and your Organization ID.

1.  **Log in to the Meraki Dashboard:** Go to [https://dashboard.meraki.com/](https://dashboard.meraki.com/).
2.  **Enable API Access:**
    * Navigate to **Organization** > **Settings**.
    * Under the **Dashboard API access** section, ensure API access is enabled.
3.  **Generate API Key:**
    * Go to your **Profile** (click your name/email in the top right) > **My profile**.
    * Scroll down to the **API access** section.
    * Click **Generate new API key**.
    * **Important:** Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You will not be able to see it again after navigating away from this page.
4.  **Find Organization ID:**
    * **Easiest Method:** The Organization ID is displayed at the bottom of every page in the Meraki dashboard.
    * **Alternative Method (API):** You can find it by making a simple API call to the `/organizations` endpoint with your API key.
    ```bash
    curl -L -H 'X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <your_api_key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' '[https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations](https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations)'
    ```

### Setting up the Integration

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** in your Home Assistant UI.
2.  Click the **+ ADD INTEGRATION** button in the bottom right.
3.  Search for "Meraki" and select it.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your API Key and Organization ID.

### Configuration Options

The following options can be configured when you first set up the integration, or at any time by navigating to the integration's card in **Settings -> Devices & Services** and clicking **Configure**.

* **Scan Interval:** How often (in seconds) to poll the Meraki API for updates. Default: 300.
* **Enable Device Tracker:** Whether to enable the device tracker entity for clients. Default: true.
* **Enable VLAN Management:** Whether to enable VLAN management entities. Default: false.
* **Ignored Networks:** A comma-separated list of network IDs to ignore.

## Custom Panel üñºÔ∏è

This integration provides a custom panel to display a dashboard of your Meraki network. The panel is automatically added to your Home Assistant sidebar when you install the integration.

## Services & Controls üéõÔ∏è

This integration provides several ways to control your Meraki network directly from Home Assistant.

### Parental Controls (Client Blocking)

For each client device that connects to your network, a `switch` entity is created. This switch allows you to block or unblock that specific client from accessing the network.

- **Entity ID:** `switch.<client_name>_internet_access`
- **How it Works:** When you turn the switch `on`, the integration adds a firewall rule to the network to block the client's traffic. Turning it `off` removes the rule.
- **Use Case:** Easily implement parental controls, such as turning off a child's internet access at bedtime through an automation.

### Content Filtering

For each network, a `select` entity is created to manage Meraki's content filtering policies.

- **Entity ID:** `select.<network_name>_content_filtering_policy`
- **How it Works:** This dropdown allows you to select the content filtering policy for the network from a list of available options ("topSites" or "fullList").

### SSID Control

You can enable or disable an entire SSID using a `switch` entity.

- **Entity ID:** `switch.<ssid_name>_enabled_control`
- **How it Works:** This switch directly enables or disables the SSID via the Meraki API.

### Device Reboot

A `reboot_device` service is available to reboot any Meraki device.

- **Service:** `meraki_ha.reboot_device`
- **Data:**
  - `serial`: The serial number of the device to reboot.

## Entities üß©

### Device & Entity Model

The integration represents different aspects of your Meraki setup as devices within Home Assistant to create a logical hierarchy:

- **Meraki Organization:** A single device entry representing your entire Meraki Organization. This acts as a parent for organization-wide sensors.
- **Meraki Networks:** Each Meraki network is registered as a "device". Physical devices and SSIDs belonging to that network are parented by this device.
- **Physical Meraki Devices:** Your actual hardware (APs, switches, cameras, etc.) are registered as devices.
- **Meraki SSIDs:** Wireless SSIDs are registered as "devices," parented by their network.
- **Meraki VLANs:** Each VLAN is registered as a "device" to group its associated sensors.

### Organization-Wide Sensors

These sensors provide aggregate client counts across your entire Meraki organization and are linked to the Organization device. The client data for these sensors is based on activity within the **last day**.
