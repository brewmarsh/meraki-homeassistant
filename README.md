- Your Meraki Organization ID.

### Installation Steps

1. **Ensure HACS is installed:** If you haven't already, install the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/).
2. **Add Custom Repository:**
    - In HACS, go to "Integrations".
    - Click the three dots in the top right and select "Custom repositories".
    - In the "Repository" field, enter the URL of this custom integration's GitHub repository.
    - For "Category", select "Integration".
    - Click "Add".
3. **Install Integration:**
    - Search for "Meraki" or the name of this integration in HACS.
    - Click "Install" and follow the prompts.
4. **Restart Home Assistant:** After installation, restart your Home Assistant instance to load the integration.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Obtaining Meraki API Credentials

To use this integration, you will need a Meraki API key and your Organization ID.

1.  **Log in to the Meraki Dashboard:** Go to [https://dashboard.meraki.com/](https://dashboard.meraki.com/).
2.  **Enable API Access:**
    * Navigate to **Organization** > **Settings**.
    * Under the **Dashboard API access** section, ensure API access is enabled.
3.  **Generate API Key:**
    * Go to your **Profile** (click your name/email in the top right) > **My profile**.
    * Scroll down to the **API access** section.
    * Click **Generate new API key**.
    * **Important:** Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You will not be able to see it again after navigating away from this page.
4.  **Find Organization ID:**
    * **Easiest Method:** The Organization ID is displayed at the bottom of every page in the Meraki dashboard.
    * **Alternative Method (API):** You can find it by making a simple API call to the `/organizations` endpoint with your API key.
    ```bash
    curl -L -H 'X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <your_api_key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' '[https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations](https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations)'
    ```

### Setting up the Integration

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** in your Home Assistant UI.
2.  Click the **+ ADD INTEGRATION** button in the bottom right.
3.  Search for "Meraki" and select it.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your API Key and Organization ID.

### Configuration Options

The following options can be configured when you first set up the integration, or at any time by navigating to the integration's card in **Settings -> Devices & Services** and clicking **Configure**.

* **How many seconds between Meraki API refreshes:** How often (in seconds) to poll the Meraki API for updates. Default: 300.
* **Where would you like the Meraki device type in the name?:** Choose how device names are presented. 'Prefix' adds the Meraki device name before the entity name, 'Suffix' adds it after, 'Omitted' uses only the entity name.
* **Auto-enable RTSP camera streams:** If checked, the integration will automatically enable the RTSP stream for all cameras that support it.
* **Use LAN IP for RTSP stream:** Controls how the RTSP stream URL is determined for cameras.
    * **When checked:** The integration will prioritize using a local IP address for the stream. It will first check if the URL from the Meraki API is already a local address. If not, it will try to construct a URL using the camera's detected LAN IP. This is the most efficient option if your Home Assistant instance is on the same local network as your cameras.
    * **When unchecked (default):** The integration will prioritize the URL provided by the Meraki API. If that URL is unavailable or invalid, it will fall back to using the camera's LAN IP as a last resort.
* **Webhook URL (optional):** A custom URL for Meraki webhooks. If left blank, the integration will use the default Home Assistant webhook URL.

## Lovelace Dashboard Card üñºÔ∏è

This integration provides a custom Lovelace card to display a dashboard of your Meraki network.

### How to Add the Card

**Step 1: Add the Javascript as a Lovelace Resource**

You must first add the `meraki-panel.js` file as a frontend resource in Home Assistant.

1.  Navigate to any of your dashboards.
2.  Click the **"..."** menu in the top right and select **"Edit Dashboard"**.
3.  Click the **"..."** menu again and select **"Manage resources"**.
4.  Click **"ADD RESOURCE"**.
5.  For the **URL**, enter `/hacsfiles/meraki-homeassistant/meraki-panel.js`.
    * *Note: This path assumes you installed the integration via HACS. If you installed it manually, the path will be `/local/meraki-panel.js` (if you placed the file in your `<config>/www` directory).*
6.  For **Resource type**, select **"JavaScript Module"**.
7.  Click **"CREATE"**.

**Step 2: Find your Meraki Config Entry ID**

The card needs to know which Meraki integration to display data from.

1.  Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2.  Find the Meraki integration and click **"CONFIGURE"**.
3.  The **Config Entry ID** will be shown in the description text at the top of the dialog (e.g., "Your Config Entry ID is: ..."). Copy this ID.

**Step 3: Add the Card to your Dashboard**

1.  Go back to your dashboard and click **"ADD CARD"**.
2.  At the bottom of the list, choose the **"Manual"** card type.
3.  In the YAML editor, paste the following code:

    ```yaml
    type: custom:meraki-lovelace-card
    config_entry_id: YOUR_CONFIG_ENTRY_ID_HERE
    ```

4.  Replace `YOUR_CONFIG_ENTRY_ID_HERE` with the ID you copied in Step 2.
5.  Click **"SAVE"**.

## Services & Controls üéõÔ∏è

This integration provides several ways to control your Meraki network directly from Home Assistant.

### Parental Controls (Client Blocking)

For each client device that connects to your network, a `switch` entity is created. This switch allows you to block or unblock that specific client from accessing the network.

- **Entity ID:** `switch.<client_name>_blocked`
- **How it Works:** When you turn the switch `on`, the integration adds an L7 firewall rule to the SSID the client is connected to, effectively blocking its traffic. Turning it `off` removes the rule.
- **Use Case:** Easily implement parental controls, such as turning off a child's internet access at bedtime through an automation.

### Content Filtering

For each SSID, a `select` entity is created to manage Meraki's content filtering policies.

- **Entity ID:** `select.<ssid_name>_content_filtering`
- **How it Works:** This dropdown allows you to select the content filtering policy for the SSID from a list of available options (e.g., "Whitelisted," "Blocked," "Family-safe"). The integration fetches the available policies from your Meraki dashboard.

### SSID Control

You can enable or disable an entire SSID using a `switch` entity.

- **Entity ID:** `switch.<ssid_name>_enabled`
- **How it Works:** This is an indirect control method that works by adding or removing a specific tag (e.g., `ha-disabled`) on the access points within the network. This method is used due to Meraki API limitations but provides a reliable way to control SSID availability.

## Entities üß©

### Device & Entity Model

The integration represents different aspects of your Meraki setup as devices within Home Assistant to create a logical hierarchy:

- **Meraki Organization:** A single device entry representing your entire Meraki Organization. This acts as a parent for organization-wide sensors.
- **Meraki Networks:** Each Meraki network is registered as a "device". Physical devices and SSIDs belonging to that network are parented by this device.
- **Physical Meraki Devices:** Your actual hardware (APs, switches, cameras, etc.) are registered as devices.
- **Meraki SSIDs:** Wireless SSIDs are registered as "devices," parented by their network.
- **Meraki VLANs:** Each VLAN is registered as a "device" to group its associated sensors.

### Organization-Wide Sensors

These sensors provide aggregate client counts across your entire Meraki organization and are linked to the Organization device. The client data for these sensors is based on activity within the **last day**.

| Entity Type | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sensor` | `Organization SSID Clients` | Total clients connected to all SSIDs across the organization. |
| `sensor` | `Organization Wireless Clients` | Total clients connected to wireless Access Points (MR series). |
