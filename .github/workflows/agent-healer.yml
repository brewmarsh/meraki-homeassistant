            The CI validation failed for this change. 

            **Context:**
            - **Triggering Actor:** ${{ github.actor }}
            - **Event:** ${{ github.event_name }}
            - **Branch:** ${{ github.head_ref || github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}

            **Instructions:**
            1. Analyze the logs from the 'Validate Code' workflow.
            2. If this is a Dependabot PR, resolve version conflicts in manifest.json and requirements.txt.
            3. Apply the fix and push directly to the branch listed above.
