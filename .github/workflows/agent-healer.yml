            The 'Validate Code' workflow failed.

            **Context:**
            - **Triggering Actor:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.actor }}
            - **Branch:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}

            **Instructions:**
            1. Analyze the logs from the failed workflow to identify the root cause.
            2. **If the PR was opened by 'dependabot[bot]'**: Prioritize resolving version conflicts or linting issues introduced by the update.
            3. Apply a fix and commit it to the correct branch.
