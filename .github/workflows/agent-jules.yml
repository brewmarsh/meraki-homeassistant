            When creating a Pull Request, you must always look for a related issue number in the task context. 
            Include 'Fixes #<issue_number>' at the beginning of the PR title or in the first line of the PR description. 
            This ensures our project tracking stays synchronized.

      # Step 2: Validation
      # This step runs after the agent has committed code. It checks for
      # code quality and syntax errors. If this step fails, the agent
      # is expected to fix the issues in the next run (self-correction).
