Great news! The Home Assistant container appears to be running successfully now. The logs no longer show any critical errors preventing startup.

The warning about the SQLite database not shutting down cleanly is normal during development and restarts, and it won't prevent Home Assistant from functioning.

You should now be able to access your local Home Assistant instance by navigating to `http://localhost:8123` in your web browser.

**Please do the following:**
1.  **Access Home Assistant** at `http://localhost:8123`.
2.  **Configure the Meraki integration** if you haven't already done so in this new instance.
3.  **Check the Meraki web UI panel** to see if the icons are visible.

Please let me know if the icons are now appearing! This will confirm that the issue was indeed a caching problem with the self-hosted runner and not a code-related issue.
