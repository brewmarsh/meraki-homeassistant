# No specific state translations needed for meraki_network_info or meraki_firmware_status
# as their states are dynamic strings (hostname/firmware version) or covered by default
# sensor state translations in Home Assistant (e.g., for "Unknown").
# If specific "Unknown" or "N/A" states for these sensors needed special translation,
# they would be added under state.sensor.<sensor_key> above.
