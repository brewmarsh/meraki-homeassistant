# English translations for Meraki Home Assistant integration
# Config and Options are now primarily managed in strings.json to reduce redundancy.
# This file will focus on entity and state translations that might differ
# or are not covered by strings.json, or for languages other than English.

entity:
  sensor:
    meraki_wan1_connectivity:
      name: "WAN 1 Connectivity"
      # State translations for this entity are now managed centrally
      # if they follow the structure in strings.json (state.sensor__meraki_wan1_connectivity)
      # or by Home Assistant default translations.
    meraki_wan2_connectivity:
      name: "WAN 2 Connectivity"
      # State translations for this entity are now managed centrally
      # if they follow the structure in strings.json (state.sensor__meraki_wan2_connectivity)
      # or by Home Assistant default translations.
    meraki_network_info:
      name: "Network Information"
    meraki_firmware_status:
      name: "Firmware Status"

# State translations that are specific to sensor states and not covered by
# entity-specific state blocks above or default HA translations would go here,
# mirroring the structure of `strings.json` if applicable.
# For example:
# state:
#   sensor__meraki_wan1_connectivity:
#     connected: "Connected"
#     disconnected: "Disconnected"
#     unknown: "Unknown"
#   sensor__meraki_wan2_connectivity:
#     connected: "Connected"
#     disconnected: "Disconnected"
#     unknown: "Unknown"
# However, as per HA best practices, if these are identical to strings.json,
# they are not strictly needed here for 'en' unless overriding.
# For now, we assume strings.json is the source for these.
