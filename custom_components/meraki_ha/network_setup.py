"""Handles the setup of Meraki network "devices" in Home Assistant.

This module provides the `async_setup_networks` function, which is intended
to be called during the integration setup process. It uses a coordinator
(referred to as `MerakiCoordinator`, which might be different from the
`MerakiDataUpdateCoordinator` used elsewhere) to get API credentials and
then calls `async_create_meraki_network_devices` to register representations
of Meraki networks as devices in the Home Assistant device registry.

Note: The distinction and interaction between `MerakiCoordinator` used here
and `MerakiDataUpdateCoordinator` (from `custom_components/meraki_ha/coordinator.py`)
should be clarified for better understanding of the architecture. This module
might represent an alternative or supplementary way of handling network device
registration compared to `coordinators/network_coordinator.py`.

    """Sets up representations of Meraki networks as devices in Home Assistant.

    This function orchestrates the creation of "network devices" in the Home
    Assistant device registry. These aren't physical devices but logical
    representations of Meraki networks, allowing entities to be associated
    at the network level.

    It retrieves the API key and organization ID from the provided coordinator
    and then calls `async_create_meraki_network_devices` (expected to be
    defined elsewhere, possibly in the `coordinators` package) to perform the
    actual device registration.

    An `aiohttp.ClientSession` is created and passed to
    `async_create_meraki_network_devices`. Careful management of this session
    is important; ideally, a shared session from `hass.helpers.aiohttp_client`
    or a session managed by the coordinator/API client itself should be used
    to avoid creating too many sessions.

    Args:
        hass (HomeAssistant): The Home Assistant instance.
        coordinator (MerakiDataUpdateCoordinator): The data update coordinator for the
            Meraki integration, providing access to API configuration (key, org ID)
            and the config entry ID.

    Raises:
        This function currently catches all exceptions during the call to
        `async_create_meraki_network_devices` and logs an error. It does not
        re-raise these exceptions.
