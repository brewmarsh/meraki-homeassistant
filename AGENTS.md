# Agent Instructions & Project Standards

## 1. Chain of Thought (Mandatory)
Before writing any code, the agent must provide a **Technical Plan** in the task response:
* **Context:** Identify the current branch and confirm it is derived from `beta`.
* **Impact:** List every file to be modified and justify the change.
* **Risk:** Identify if the change affects shared files like `manifest.json` or `strings.json`.
* **Verification:** State exactly which command will be used to test the fix.

## 2. Git & Branch Management
* **Targeting:** ALL work MUST target the `beta` branch. `main` is protected for production releases only.
* **Branch Naming:** Use the following prefixes:
    * `feat/` for new capabilities.
    * `fix/` for bug fixes.
    * `chore/` for maintenance (security audits, dependency updates).
    * `refactor/` for code structure changes (like the `meraki_select` rename).
* **Linear History:** Use `git rebase origin/beta`. Merge commits are forbidden.

## 3. Separation of Concerns & Architecture
* **Platform Isolation:** Keep logic for `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, and `select` strictly within their respective files.
* **Module Shadowing:** NEVER name a local folder after a standard Python library.
    * *Rule:* `custom_components/meraki_ha/select/` MUST be `custom_components/meraki_ha/meraki_select/`.
* **UI vs Logic:** Integration setup logic belongs in `config_flow.py`; hardware communication belongs in `api.py` or `coordinator.py`.
* **Selectors:** Raw Voluptuous types are forbidden in `config_flow.py`. Use `homeassistant.helpers.selector`.

## 4. Environment & Dependencies
* **Testing Stubs:** Do not install `homeassistant` core in CI. Use `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`.
* **Security:** `pip-audit` must be run with the `-l` (local) flag to ignore system packages (e.g., `ufw`, `cloud-init`).

## 5. Automated Self-Correction
* If a merge conflict is detected, the agent is authorized to self-initiate a rebase onto `beta`.
* If a CI failure occurs, the agent must read the error log, explain the failure in the PR, and attempt one automated fix before requesting human intervention.

## 6. Repository Map (Source of Truth)
* `custom_components/meraki_ha/`: Root of the integration.
* `config_flow.py`: UI setup and validation logic.
* `coordinator.py`: Data update coordinator (API polling logic).
* `api.py`: Direct interactions with the Meraki Dashboard API.
* `tests/`: All pytest logic (do not create tests outside this folder).

## 7. Code Style Examples
* **Async/Await:** All I/O bound operations MUST be async.
  * *Bad:* `requests.get(url)`
  * *Good:* `await hass.async_add_executor_job(requests.get, url)` OR use `aiohttp`.
* **Logging:** Use the integration logger, not print.
  * *Good:* `_LOGGER.debug("Meraki device %s found", device_id)`
* **Type Hinting:** Strictly enforce `Callables`, `Awaitables`, and `ConfigEntry` types.

## 8. Forbidden Patterns (Strict)
* **NO** `time.sleep()`: This blocks the Home Assistant event loop.
* **NO** generic `except Exception:`: You must catch specific errors (e.g., `ClientError`, `TimeoutError`) to prevent swallowing bugs.
* **NO** hardcoded secrets: Never hardcode API keys or Org IDs in tests; use `tests/conftest.py` fixtures.

## 9. Pull Request Requirements
Every PR description generated by an agent MUST include:
1. **Summary:** One sentence explaining the "Why".
2. **Type:** (Bugfix/Feature/Chore).
3. **Test Proof:** A snippet of the successful `pytest` or `pip-audit` output.
4. **Manual Verification:** A statement confirming the code was checked against the `AGENTS.md` rules.
