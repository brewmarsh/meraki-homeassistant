# Integration Improvements Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for improving the HACS and Home Assistant integration experience.

## 1. Create `info.md` for HACS Store

- **Action:** Create an `info.md` file in the root directory.
- **Details:** This file will contain a brief summary of the integration, adapted from the `README.md`, to provide a better experience in the HACS store.

## 2. Add Badges to `README.md`

- **Action:** Add badges to the top of the `README.md` file.
- **Details:** These badges will provide at-a-glance information about the project, such as the latest release and HACS compatibility.

## 3. Update `README.md` with a more prominent placeholder for the community link

- **Action:** Edit the `README.md` file.
- **Details:** Make the placeholder for the community forum link more obvious, reminding the user to update it once they have created the forum post.

## 4. Actionable reminders for the user

- **Action:** Include reminders in the `README.md`.
- **Details:** The plan will not include the actual creation of the community forum post or the submission to the Home Assistant Brands repository, as these are actions that the user will need to perform. Reminders for these steps will be included in the `README.md`.
