### **AI Agent Instructions**

**Persona:** Meticulous and knowledgeable Python engineer with a deep understanding of Home Assistantâ€™s architecture.

**Objective:** The primary goal is to restore the core functionality of the Home Assistant Camera entity for Meraki MV devices, which was inadvertently removed during a previous refactor. This task requires precision and adherence to the established architectural pattern.

**Task Requirements:**

1.  **Reintroduce the Camera Entity:** Locate and modify the `MVHandler` class to re-integrate the `MerakiCamera` entity as a discovered component.
2.  **Maintain Service-Oriented Design:** Ensure the camera entity is correctly instantiated with the necessary dependency, `CameraService`, which provides the underlying logic for fetching video streams and snapshots. The `MVHandler` should receive `CameraService` as a dependency in its `__init__` method.
3.  **Ensure Correct Imports:** Verify all required classes (`MerakiCamera`, `CameraService`, `MerakiDataCoordinator`, etc.) are correctly imported in the relevant files to prevent `ImportError` exceptions.
4.  **Preserve Existing Functionality:** The refactor must not negatively impact any other entities handled by `MVHandler`, such as motion sensors or analytics counts. All existing functionality must remain intact.
5.  **Robustness and Error Handling:** The implementation must be robust, with clear logging messages to assist with future debugging. The code should handle potential API call failures gracefully.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing:** The agent must update existing unit tests for the `MVHandler` to specifically assert that a `MerakiCamera` entity is created and returned by the `discover_entities` method.

### **Implementation Plan**

The implementation will follow a three-phase approach to ensure a controlled and verifiable re-integration of the camera functionality.

**Phase 1: Code Re-integration**

1.  **Update the `MVHandler`:**
      * Open `custom_components/meraki_ha/discovery/handlers/mv.py`.
      * Add the necessary import for the `MerakiCamera` class at the top of the file:
        ```python
        from ...camera import MerakiCamera
        ```
      * Within the `MVHandler`'s `__init__` method, ensure that `camera_service` is correctly passed and stored as an attribute (`self._camera_service`).
      * Inside the `discover_entities` method, add the code to instantiate and append the `MerakiCamera` entity to the list of entities to be returned. This should be the first entity appended, as it is the primary entity for a camera device.
        ```python
        # Always create the base camera entity
        entities.append(
            MerakiCamera(
                self._coordinator,
                self.device,
                self._camera_service,
            )
        )
        ```
2.  **Review the `DeviceDiscoveryService`:**
      * Open `custom_components/meraki_ha/discovery/service.py`.
      * Verify that the `MVHandler` is being instantiated with the `camera_service` in the `discover_entities` method. This step is critical to ensure the `MVHandler` has the dependency it needs to create the camera entity.

**Phase 2: Test Suite Refinement**

1.  **Update the `MVHandler` Tests:**
      * Open `tests/discovery/handlers/test_mv.py`.
      * Modify the `test_mv_handler_all_features` test case.
      * Add a new assertion to the test to explicitly check for the presence of a `MerakiCamera` instance in the list of returned entities.
        ```python
        assert any(isinstance(e, MerakiCamera) for e in entities)
        ```
      * Ensure all other existing test cases are updated to also include this assertion, as a `MerakiCamera` entity should now always be discovered for an MV device.

**Phase 3: Validation and Finalization**

1.  **Run All Tests:** Execute the entire test suite to confirm that all existing and new tests pass successfully, especially those related to the `MVHandler`.
2.  **Manual Verification:** Provide instructions for manual testing within Home Assistant. This involves installing the updated integration and verifying that the camera entity is correctly created, the stream is accessible, and snapshot functionality works.
3.  **Code Cleanup:** Once validated, remove any temporary or legacy code from the refactor and finalize the file with clear comments and docstrings.
