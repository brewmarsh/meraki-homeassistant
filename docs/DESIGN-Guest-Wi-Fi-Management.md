# Design Proposal: Guest Wi-Fi Management (with Splash Page)

This document outlines the design for the "Guest Wi-Fi Management" feature for the Meraki Home Assistant integration's web UI.

## 1. Feature Goal

To provide a simple and convenient way for users to manage their guest Wi-Fi network directly from the Home Assistant web UI, without needing to log in to the Meraki dashboard. The primary focus will be on enabling/disabling the guest network, managing its password, and optionally configuring a custom, self-hosted splash page with email collection.

## 2. UI Design (on a new "Guest Wi-Fi" page)

The page will be divided into two main sections:

### Section 1: Basic Guest Network Control
*   **Enable Guest Wi-Fi:** A toggle switch to enable/disable the guest SSID.
*   **Guest Wi-Fi Password:** A text input to view and change the password, with a save button.

### Section 2: Custom Splash Page Configuration
*   **Enable Custom Splash Page:** A main toggle switch for this feature.
*   When enabled, the following options appear:
    *   **Splash Page Content:** A text area where you can enter a welcome message or terms of service for your splash page.
    *   **Collect Email Addresses:** A checkbox to enable a simple email sign-up form on the splash page.
    *   **Splash Page URL:** A read-only field showing the public URL where your splash page will be hosted (e.g., `http://<your_ha_public_url>/api/meraki_ha/splash/{network_id}`).

**Important Security Note:** A clear warning message will be displayed here:
> "Enabling this feature will automatically create a firewall rule (a 'walled garden' exception) to allow unauthenticated guest devices to access this Home Assistant URL. Please ensure your Home Assistant instance is securely configured."

## 3. Implementation Plan & Instructions for a Continuing Agent

### Goal
Implement the "Guest Wi-Fi Management" feature as described above.

### Prerequisites
*   Familiarity with creating Home Assistant `switch` and `text` entities.
*   Knowledge of the Meraki API for managing SSIDs.
*   Familiarity with React (functional components, hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`).
*   Understanding of how to make API calls in JavaScript using `fetch`.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### 1. Backend: Core Entities & API
*   **Entities:**
    *   Implement the `MerakiGuestWifiPasswordText` entity as previously described.
*   **Web Server (`web_server.py`):**
    *   **Public Splash Page Endpoint:** Create a new, unauthenticated route like `/api/meraki_ha/splash/{network_id}`. This route will serve a modern-looking HTML page. The content of this page will be dynamically generated based on the user's settings (the custom content and whether the email form is enabled).
    *   **Email Collection Endpoint:** Create a new endpoint like `/api/meraki_ha/splash_signup` to handle the form submission from the splash page. This endpoint will save the collected email addresses (e.g., to a `.csv` file in your `config` directory).
    *   **Configuration Endpoints:** Create new API endpoints (`/api/guest_wifi/splash_settings`) for the frontend to get and set the splash page configuration (enabled, content, email collection setting).

#### 2. Backend: Meraki API Interaction
*   When the user enables the custom splash page, the integration will need to make a series of API calls:
    1.  **Update SSID Settings:** Call `PUT /networks/{networkId}/wireless/ssids/{number}` to set:
        *   `splashPage` to `"Click-through splash page"`.
        *   `splashUrl` to the public URL of the new splash page endpoint.
    2.  **Update Firewall Rules:** Call `PUT /networks/{networkId}/wireless/ssids/{number}` to update the `walledGardenRanges`. The public URL of your Home Assistant instance must be added to this list to allow guest devices to access the splash page.

#### 3. Frontend: UI Implementation
*   Create the new **"Guest Wi-Fi"** page (`GuestWifiPage.jsx`) as designed above.
*   The page will fetch its state from the new backend endpoints.
*   The "Save" buttons will post the configuration back to the backend.

#### 4. Build and Verify
*   As before, this will involve building the frontend and using a Playwright script to test the new UI and its functionality.
