# Proactive Code Health Improvement Plan

This document outlines a high-level plan for improving the health and maintainability of the `meraki_ha` custom component, based on observations made during the `ha-refactor-fix2` debugging session.

## 1. Full Test Suite Audit & Refactor

**Problem:** The test suite was significantly out of sync with the application code, leading to a cascade of failures during refactoring. This indicates a lack of maintenance and makes future development risky and time-consuming.

**Action:**
- Meticulously review every test file.
- Update tests that are failing due to signature changes in the application code.
- Delete obsolete tests that are no longer relevant to the current architecture.
- Refactor complex and brittle mocks to be simpler, more robust, and reusable.
- Prioritize fixing the core integration test (`test_ssid_device_creation_and_unification`) to ensure a reliable end-to-end check of the component setup workflow.

## 2. Standardize All Handler Interfaces

**Problem:** Different device handlers (`MXHandler`, `GXHandler`, `MSHandler`, etc.) had inconsistent constructor signatures, making the discovery service logic complex and prone to `TypeError`s.

**Action:**
- Enforce a standard, consistent interface for all classes that inherit from `BaseDeviceHandler`.
- This includes standardizing the arguments passed in the constructor.
- This will simplify the `DeviceDiscoveryService` and make it easier to add new handlers in the future.

## 3. Improve Dependency Management

**Problem:** The `DeviceDiscoveryService` constructor has a large and growing number of parameters. While explicit dependency injection is good, this can become unwieldy and hard to manage.

**Action:**
- Investigate creating a dedicated "services" or "context" object.
- This object would act as a container for all necessary services (`control_service`, `camera_service`, `network_control_service`, etc.).
- The context object would be passed to the `DeviceDiscoveryService`, which can then access the services it needs.
- This will clean up constructor signatures across the application and make it easier to add new shared services in the future.
